# Analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts

Many applications, including gene trend plotting and driver gene identification, require continuous information on continuous state chage. Thus, we comprised a
new, real-time-informed pseudotime approach, which embeds the experimental time points in the continuous landscape of expression changes. We compare this new
pseudotime to the well-established methods DPT and Palantir, and highlight the inherently discrete gene expression change considered in classical OT.
